Hey, I’m Zara 👾
Welcome to my GitHub crib—where ideas turn into code, coffee turns into commits, and chaos occasionally turns into something useful. I’m a full-stack de" who thrives on solving problems, breaking things (on purpose), and making the internet a weirder, better place.

The Stats 📊

    Lines of Code Written: Enough to wrap around the moon (probably).
    Bugs Squashed: More than I’d like to admit.
    Current Fuel: Coffee ☕ | Tea 🍵 | [Your quirky fuel, e.g., "Red Bull and spite"].
    Superpower: Turning “It’s not working” into “Oh, it’s working now.”


What I Do 🛠️
I build stuff that "looks dope in browsers". My toolkit’s packed with:  

    Languages: [e.g., Python, JavaScript, Rust, etc.]  
    Frameworks: [e.g., React, Django, Flutter, etc.]  
    Secret Weapons: [e.g., Vim shortcuts, regex black magic, duct tape]

Check out my pinned repos below—they’re the coolest kids on this block.

The Vibe Check ✨

    Currently Hacking On: [What you’re working on now, e.g., "A robot that insults my code."]  
    Learning: [e.g., "How to not cry when Docker breaks."]

Let’s Connect 🚀

    Say hi, collab, or send me memes—I’m down for it all.

“Code is poetry, but sometimes it’s a haiku about error 404.” — Me, probably
Thanks for swinging by! Stick around, star a repo, or fork something wild. Let’s make the digital universe a little more awesome together.
